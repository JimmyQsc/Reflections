1. What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
It will create a .git subdirectory in the project
root, which contains all of the necessary metadata
for the repo.
run the git init command.
2. How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?
Working directory is the folder you currently in, you
use git init to initialize a git repository, you add
files to the staging area so when you run the git commit
command, you only commit the files you've added to the
staging area.
