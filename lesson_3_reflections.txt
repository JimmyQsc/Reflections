1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?
when I'm working with other prople, or share my projects,
and when i constantly switching computer, i can store my
project on github and edit it anywhere.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
when i working locally, i don't want my code to change while
i'm working on it.
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is a special feature provided by github, it allows you
to copy/clone one's repo into your github profile, its basically
clone it on github's server, and it will keep track of the number
 of fork one get. i use it to copy other people's repo to my
account and modify it on my own and i can share it with others
on github.
clones are git repositories copied from other places, it is
exactly like the original one, clone from github will set the repo
one github the remote to the local one.
branches are created in the same repo, and branches has its name
can be merged with other branch to create a merge commit.
4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?
i can work offline with that state, and perform merge while i'm
offline.
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use a IM software or meet with others to collaborate
i also have to copy all file to that person. git and gitHub are
difinetely the better solution.
6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather
 than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
when working with a lage group of people, its better to create separate
branch, when working on my own, it's convinient to working on master
branch.
