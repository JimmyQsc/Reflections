1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?
when I'm working with other prople, or share my projects,
and when i constantly switching computer, i can store my
project on github and edit it anywhere.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?
when i working locally, i don't want my code to change while
i'm working on it.
